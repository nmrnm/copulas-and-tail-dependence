# Copulas and Tail dependence

This is a repository of some of the research that I did over the summer of 2020 at Kansas Biological Survey in quantitative ecology under [Dr. Reuman](https://eeb.ku.edu/dr-daniel-reuman). Obviously, nothing groundbreaking here, and everything is a bit disorganized and undocumented as the reseach project was never completed. This project ended up becoming more theory and math involved with non-practical results.

I may in the future create a R markdown file to sort of explain or update this readme to explain more in detail of what I had done and learned. It might also be cool to demonstrate things like the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem). But for now, this repo is an archive of some of the things that I had learned during the summer of 2020.

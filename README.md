# Copulas and Tail dependence

This is a repository of some of the research that I did in quantitative ecology over the summer of 2020 at Kansas Biological Survey under [Dr. Reuman](https://eeb.ku.edu/dr-daniel-reuman). Obviously, nothing groundbreaking here, and everything is a bit disorganized and undocumented as the reseach project was never completed. This isn't that much code either considering the amount of time I spent on this. The project ended up becoming more theory and math involved than originally intended and ended up with non-practical results.

I may in the future create a R-markdown file to sort of explain or update this to explain more what I learned as well as what I had done. It might also be cool to demonstrate things like the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem). But for now, this repo is an archive of my growth/failure during the summer of 2020.
